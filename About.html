            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Software Engineer focused on building web applications with AI-driven capabilities</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
            <p>I am a Computer Engineering graduate and software engineer specializing in building modern, user-focused web applications and integrating AI-driven features into real-world products. My work focuses on clean user interfaces, scalable backend systems, and practical AI integration to solve meaningful problems. I aim to build production-ready software that balances performance, usability, and maintainability.</p>
            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Web Application Development</li>
                    <p>Designing and building responsive, accessible web interfaces with a focus on user experience and maintainable front-end architecture.</p>
                <li>Backend & APIs</li>
                    <p>Building scalable backend services and APIs to support real-world application workflows and data handling.</p>  
                <li>AI-Driven Product Features</li>
                    <p>Integrating AI capabilities such as conversational interfaces, content processing, and automation into web and application workflows.</p>
                <li>Production Mindset</li>
                    <p>Focusing on reliability, performance, and deployment-readiness rather than just prototypes.</p>

            </ul>
            <h2>Engineering Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I believe in building software that is simple, maintainable, and user-centered. I prioritize clean architecture, clear documentation, and incremental improvement. My approach emphasizes solving real problems, validating ideas quickly, and continuously refining solutions based on feedback and performance considerations.</p>
            <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
            <p>My journey into software engineering has been driven by a strong interest in building practical products at the intersection of web development and artificial intelligence. Over time, I have worked on projects ranging from responsive web interfaces to full-stack applications with AI-enabled features, developing a strong foundation in both front-end and backend systems. This progression has shaped my current focus on building production-ready, AI-augmented applications.</p>
            <h2>What I’m Focused On Now</h2>
            <ul>
               <li> Building scalable web platforms with clean UI/UX</li>
               <li>Developing AI-enabled features for real-world use cases</li>
               <li>Improving system design and backend architecture</li>
               <li>Preparing products for real-world deployment and growth</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
            <p>Outside of development, I enjoy structured problem-solving, exploring product design patterns, and creating story-driven content. These interests help me think creatively about user experience and narrative-driven product design.</p>
            <h2>Call to Action</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>“View my projects to see selected work and case studies.”</li>
                <li>“Feel free to reach out via the contact page for collaboration or opportunities.”</li>
            </ul>
